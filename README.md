# Tell Us a Climate Story - NASA Space Apps Challenge 2024

**Team:** Nova Strikers  
**Challenge:** Tell Us a Climate Story  
**Year:** 2024

## 🌍 Project Overview

"Tell Us a Climate Story" is an interactive web application that transforms complex climate data into engaging visual narratives through comics. Our project focuses on three major U.S. cities - Indianapolis, Los Angeles, and New York City - showcasing real NASA climate research through compelling storytelling.

## 🎯 Mission

We believe that climate science should be accessible to everyone. By combining NASA's greenhouse gas emission data with interactive comics, we make complex environmental research understandable and engaging for diverse audiences.

## 🏙️ Featured Cities & Stories

### 1. Indianapolis - "Indy Climate Chronicles"
- **Focus:** Indianapolis Flux Experiment (INFLUX)
- **Data:** CO₂ and Methane concentrations (2011-2023)
- **Character:** Alex, Climate Researcher
- **Story:** Follows NIST's groundbreaking urban greenhouse gas measurement project

### 2. Los Angeles - "Greener Skies: Sarah's Fight for Sustainable L.A"
- **Focus:** Urban emissions measurement in diverse microclimates
- **Data:** NIST greenhouse gas monitoring across LA air basin
- **Characters:** Sarah and City Planner
- **Story:** Community-driven sustainability efforts in a major metropolitan area

### 3. New York City - "Invisible Threats in Air"
- **Focus:** Multi-stakeholder climate monitoring collaboration
- **Data:** Satellite and ground-based emissions tracking
